A few weeks ago, I was posting about the Best Animation Company in the world, and mainly the people who make it what it is.  
And last week-end, I went to see Prince performing the last show of 21 Nights in London.  
I'll pass on the already great experience he was offering to European people: 21 shows over two months and a half, most of them followed by a two-hours after-show performance. More than most of the fans of any artist would dare dreaming of.  
I'll also pass on the fact that more than 400 000 people attended the shows, or that he was offering his last Album for free at the entrance...  
The whole Sha-Bang for 31&pound; (62 with the after-show ticket).  
So, if I pass on these pretty remarkable stuff, what will I post about ?...  
What about a recipe ? Well...

* Take a young Genius in the late '70s, who played multiple music instruments way before 10, signed his first deal with Warner Brothers at 17 (and that's much more to say than today's deals...), wrote dozens of hits, etc...
* Add 30 years of successful experience: 30 albums or so, as many tours (each including hours of rehearsals, performance and after shows).
* Mix with a few other well-known-geniuses: a dash of Miles Davis, a few drops of Ron Wood, a frosted Larry Graham, a tasty Lenny Kravitz, and a full Maceo Parker. If you have some George Clinton in your kitchen, pour some.  
* Shake everything with an incredibly tight band.  
* Spread over a large loyal-fan-base.

What do you get ?  
**Quintessence of greatness of Funky Music.**  
Nothing less.  
If you had been nice, I'd have gave you a taste...  
But we all know you are not...
