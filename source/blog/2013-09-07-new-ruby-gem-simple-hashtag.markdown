title: New Ruby Gem-Simple Hashtag 
---

Today, I released a small Ruby Gem: [Simple Hashtag](https://github.com/ralovely/simple_hashtag).  
In a Rails app, it will allow you to very easily implement a categorising system, via hashtag.

You (or your users) just have to put a #hashtag inside your text,  
and the Gem will pick it up and store a reference in an index to allow you to retreive it later.

It's a special Gem for me: it's the first I'm able to release in the wild.  
It's quite simple, but I hope in can be of service.

The ReadMe should tell you all you need to know about it,  
if not, shoot me an email.
