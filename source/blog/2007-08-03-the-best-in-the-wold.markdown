The other day, I used the term "The best in the world", but it felt different.  
When you think about it, we tend to over exaggerate when we speak, using superlatives and all : _Greatest, Truly Gorgeous, the most Amazing..._.  
How many times did you say _You gotta see this guys work, he's the best in the world..._ ?  
And how many times did you actually mean it ?..  
Yep, not that much.

But the other day, it felt different.  
I said it, and it sounded... real.  
I was talking about [Pixar](http://www.pixar.com/)&trade;.  
These guys, many of them, are the best in the world.  
In almost every movie-related activities, you can't find anyone better.  
That's an abyssal thought.  
They don't make mistake. Right now, they can't fail.  
I just went to see Ratatouille, their last movie.  
It's flawless. Perfect.  
And not just the 3D animation, but the characters, the story, the rhythm, the casting.  
Even if you're ego-less, somewhere, deep inside, it must feel good to know you're The Best (no, not you reading that louzy blog, the guys at Pixar&trade;... :p ).
