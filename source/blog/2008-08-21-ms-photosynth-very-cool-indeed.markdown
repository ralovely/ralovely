Most of my 2 readers know that: I'm a Mac Fan Boy...  
We could put it another way: I'm usually not impressed with what comes out of Microsoft.  
But once in a while, let's face it, they have some pretty cool stuff.  
[Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/) is cool, for instance.  
But this time it's more than cool. This time, it's mega-cool.  
This time it's [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/).  
I discovered it like 2 years ago, via there [Live Lab](http://livelabs.com/ "MS Live Labs") website.  
Photosynth takes a collection of photos of the same place, and merge them in a huge 3D/360Â° panoramic.  
It's completly amazing.  
At first, it was a University of Washington project called [Photo Tourism](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/), and they didn't screw it when they brought it back in Redmond.  
The videos of the prototype are down, now that the product is live. One is available on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p16frKJLVi0 "Photosynth Proto on Youtube") though (even if it's less appealing in low res...). They also presented a demo at [TED](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.html "Photosynth @ TED") last year.

You can't access Photosynth from a Mac. I especially like the phrasing of the error page:<blockquote>Unfortunately, we're not cool enough to run on your OS yet.</blockquote>  
BootCamped Mac will do; parallel or VMware won't.  
Try it, it's really amazing.
