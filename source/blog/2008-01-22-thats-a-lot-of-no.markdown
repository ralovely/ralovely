title: That's a lot of NO

**NO** external drive,  
**NO** FireWire,  
**NO** Ethernet,  
**NO** PC Card.  
That's the price of **[AIR](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/)**. (That and $1799...).   
That's a lot of NOs comapred to what we're used to, compared to what we expect (plenty of _yes_ and _more_).  
**BUT** (that's one big but !) as any Apple product: wait to hold one in your hands before you judge,  
**AND** try to let go old dying concept once in a while. You might even enjoy it.

To sum up: **NO**, **NO**, **NO**, **NO**, **BUT**, **AND** !  
_(Note: still, it lacks a 3G modem to fully embrace mobility. It will come soon)._
