([TLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain): Top-Domain Level as in .com, .fr or .org)

If you have to buy a domain name in the future, don't waste any time wondering, **you want a .com.**  
Demonstration:  
First, when was the last time you typed _http://_ ? Yep, that long...  
Then, try and get rid of the _www_.  
If you spend just a few minutes a day browsing, you know hardly type these anymore too.  
Some [wrote](http://dmiessler.com/archive/its-time-to-drop-the-www) about it, and even started a [movement](http://no-www.org/).  
So we came from **http://www.apple.com** to **apple.com**.  
Now, strip the _.com_ off. Yes, still works...  
The reason is that, by hitting enter (or ctrl-enter depending on your browser), if you didn't provide a TLD, it will append .com for you.  
**.com, not .fr or .org...**  
Of course, if you're an advanced user, you can configure that behaviour, but honestly, who will ?  
So, how long before we actually forget about TLD altogether ?  
Most people are [already](http://franticindustries.com/blog/2007/01/28/google-is-the-new-http/) using Google as an adress bar, mostly out of lazyness if you ask me.  
How long before we drop the TLD system anyway. I would by the minute.  
I find it harder to remember the TLD than the address in the first place; companies buy every domain available since day one; even if TLD system multiply the available number of domain names, if two sites are in conflict over a name (ie.: one in .com, the other in .net), both are penalised anyway.  
Honestly, how convenient would it be to only have to remember/type _apple_, or _ralovely_ ?  
I already do (thanks to my favorite browser), and I love it.  
p.s.: The Enter key (without ctrl) in FireFox will take you to the Google top response (I'm Feeling Lucky&#153;).
