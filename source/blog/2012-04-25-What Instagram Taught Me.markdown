title: What Instagram Taught Me
---

Well, actually it's more _One of the thing Instagram taught me_, there are many lessons in Instagram short history (one of them being _How to make a billion bucks in two years_).  
Here, I'm focusing on a photography lesson.

Well, actually it's more a reminder than a lesson.  
The acurate title would then be _What Photography Lesson Instagram Reminded Me_.  
But it's less catchy.

So. This lesson ?  
**PolaroidÂ® was right.**  
(And Hasselblad before that. And Rollei before that)

I love Polaroids. I managed to document the last 15 years of my life with approximatively 2 000 of them. I wait for a less _beta feeling_ of [The Impossible Project](http://www.the-impossible-project.com/) like the rebirth of Steve Jobs, and I cherish my collection like my second nipple.  
Most of us love Polaroids. And we already know why we love them :
* instant unique moments,
* carefully curated images,
* in a square aspect ratio.

And that's exactly what Instagram recreated. Adding the sharing feature was not what made a killer product out of it ; it's handy at best. I'd love Instagram the same if all it did was saving the pictures on my phone, or upload them to Flickr.

So, how will I use this reknewed knowledge, then ?  
Well, I will apply it to the output stream of my DSLR.  
Each _event_ I cover with it generates a few hundreds pictures, painfully trimed to a few dozens, hastily and mecanically _Lightroomed_, before being fed to the audience.  
Now, I shall pick a few ones, enhanced them in any way I please (including adding filters if I feel like it), crop them to a perfect square, and, finally, delight the viewers (or not, but I don't care as long as I'm satisfied).  

Same lesson goes for the display of the pictures.  
Today, I present them via a private website, nicely ordered by events, each nicely ordered in a grid...  
The objective is much simpler: a constant feed of captioned pictures, one after the other, in the very same way Instagram presents them.
