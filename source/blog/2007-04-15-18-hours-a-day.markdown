There is one thing I do all day long.  
And when I say all day long, I mean it.

It's listening to music.

It's just vital for me, like breathing.  
I wake, I put on music, and when I arrive at work, I turn the music on before turning the iPod off...  
So naturally, I'll write about music here.  
The music I like of course, the shows I attend to...

Makes me think, I'll have to put a little player also, to share some of it.
