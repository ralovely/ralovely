This one is more for Paris based readers.  
A friend of mine launched his company, and doing that, his web site also : [culinairement-votre.fr](http://culinairement-votre.fr).  
Being a cook, he offers his services to cook for you, or to teach you how to cook.  
He's not the first, nor the last, but he might be one of the best...  
Regarding the site, I built it and I have to say, I like how it feels.  
The Ã¼bber connected among you might see an influence (which I won't divulge ; as [Einstein said](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins109782.html) : _The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources._...)
