The Problem With Social Networks: **Multiple personalities.**  
All of us - as human beings - have many aspects. We come in many flavors. That's what makes human interactions so complex and interesting.  
There is a _Working-You_, a _Family-You_, a _Friendly-You_...  
More than that, for each one of these _Yous__ there are different versions.  
At work, you don't behave the same with your boss's boss and with your co-worker in the next cubicle.  
With family, there is the _yearly great-great-aunt's family reunion You_, and the _Sunday's garden Hot Dog party with your 3 brothers and their wives and kids&nbsp;You_.  
The same goes with friends.  
Then there are the places. If you're in the street, in a theatre, in a cosy restaurant, or at home, you won't behave exactly the same.  
All this is for a regular quiet life.  
It gets trickier when there's _your wife's You_ and _that cute little blond girl you met at work's You_...  
Topics of conversation, vocabulary, plain behaviour, won't be the same.

This guy I work with (or more precisely, I work in the same company as he), sends me an invite to be friend on Facebook.  
Two options: trying not to be rude, accepting the invite OR being consistent, refusing the invite: WE ARE NOT FRIENDS.  
(I'm not talking about the networking use of Facebook - interesting thought by Seth Godin [here](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/who-you-know.html) though).  
Or  
This great conversations I have with my WOW guild isn't of any interest for my wife. Worse, the more I talk about it, the more she resent it.  
Or  
This project I want to discuss only with my closest family doesn't concern any of my friends, even less my so called-facebook-friends.

There are a few initiative in this direction. [HonestyBox](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2552096927) is a great Facebook App, it brings something really missing.  
You can send a message anonymously. At last, you can be something else than just _polite_ or _nice_.  
There are also private social networks or VIP-only social networks.  
[ModelsHotel](http://modelshotel.com/index.php?mode=about) is one of them. As Michael Arrington said: [If You're Not A Model, Don't Bother Reading This](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/10/if-youre-not-a-model-dont-bother-reading-this/).  
So where is the solution ?  
You can have as many social account as personalities. This can become hard to track...  
You can try and set a really complex permission/privacy panel on the one and only network you choose (if it has this kind of option, today, I don't know any that has).  
Clearly these are not real options.  
That leaves room for innovation...
