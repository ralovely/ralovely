What was a tedious concept is now an easy-to-configure device.

We said it again and again and again: **BACK UP YOUR DATA !**

How can you justify loosing 4 years of photo in a snap ?...  
Photos of Xmas, photos of the kid's bday, photos of the other kid's graduation... I, for myself, couldn't live with that (or should I say without...).  
Apple made this easy for you: introducing [Time Capsule](http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/).  
No more excuses.  
Run.
