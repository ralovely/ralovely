I love my new [microwave oven](http://www.samsung.com/fr/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=homeappliances&type=microwaves&subtype=mono_function&model_cd=MW82P/XEF).  
You just can't make any simpler.  
2 rotating knobs. That's all ! One for power setting, the other for timing.  
Nothing else, not even a _start_ button.  
And that's the beauty. Once you set the timer, it goes off by itself, 1 second later.

The same goes for every thing designed.  
Be it a graphic design, a web design, an industrial design...  
You made a simple product, almost an archetype.  
Find that extra button you can get rid of.
