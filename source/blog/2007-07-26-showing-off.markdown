Last week, I went to see the Prince show in Montreux, at the Jazz Festival.  
A 2h30 show, followed by a 40 mn AfterParty (yes a little short, but soooo good).  
Nothing special to say about that, just showing off. :p

I can't wait to get my hands on the CDs.  
(also, during the wait in the _Stravinsky Auditorium_, I heard the new album over the PA. I don't like it.)
