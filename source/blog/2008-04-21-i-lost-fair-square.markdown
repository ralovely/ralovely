This is one of these moments...  
A bitter taste and a hard time getting through.  
I was just beaten, Fair &amp; Square, on the finish line, building a small web app.  
Here is how it started.  
Like many I was first confused when I heard about [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"), a few months ago.  
Some kind of broadcasted one-way IM, 140 characters limited.  
I didn't even Twitted at first. [I only started this January](http://twitter.com/ralovely).  
As Robert Scoble - famous [blogger](http://scobleizer.com/ "scobleizer") and huge [Twitterer](http://twitter.com/scobleizer) - understood it, the [secret to Twitter](http://scobleizer.com/2008/03/23/the-secret-to-twitter/ "Scoble on Twitter") is the number (and quality) of people [you are following](http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/13/twitter-and-inadequacy-er-the-great-friend-divide/), not the other way around. I also like these two twitts about [noise](http://twitter.com/Scobleizer/statuses/779385744) and [signal](http://twitter.com/Scobleizer/statuses/779386231).  
None of my friends are on Twitter. So I started following people from the Mac community and from the Web developer community. But it wasn't enough. So I went through the list of people followed by the ones I was following.  
You follow me ?  
Of course, this would be cool if it could be done automatically.  
_"Hey! I could write it !"_ - he said to himself.  
I first searched for an existing product - Nothing, I'm good to go. Fame &amp; Glory are mine !  
Then I searched the [Twitter API](http://twitter.com/help/api "Twitter API"), fired up Textmate, and coded it.  
I started 2-3 weeks ago, late at night, after home was asleep.  
I have all the backend, I even registered the Domain Name: [TwittsOfMyTwitts.com](http://twittsofmytwitts.com/ "TwittsOfMyTwitts").  
(What you have there is only the development pages. It works, but there is not a single line of styling, nor Javascript/Ajax).  
And tonight, browsing the web, I find [this](http://www.crazybob.org/twubble/ "twubble")...  
The exact same thing (but finished and polished), gone public 2 days ago.  
Aarrrrgh.  
It was written by [Bob Lee](http://crazybob.org/ "Bob Lee"), a software engineer @ Google.  
Here is an [interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnxaV8jt_28 "Bob Lee Interview") of his experience writting Twubble.

OK. STOP. Introspection time:
- The idea is dead simple. Probably dozens thought of it, and way before.
- He finished it before me. Even a few days counts.
- His code is nicer than mine.  
**but**
- My domain name is better ;) .
- I'm not a software engineer @ Google nor a software engineer, nor an engineer at all. I'm not even a web developer, yet !
- My final product would have been really close to his  
(_You will have to take my word for it on this one_).

So, all in all, that's not such a bad day. I'm OK, loosing this one to Bob Lee.  
Being so close might even be a compliment.  
It still sucks: I was pretty eager to **finally** have something going public.

P.S.: Bob, If you read this, I just wonder:
- How did you get passed the 70 requests limitation of Twitter ? 
- How the hell did you get on this page ?!
