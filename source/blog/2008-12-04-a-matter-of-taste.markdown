A few weeks ago, I went to [Fat Freddy's Drop](http://www.fatfreddysdrop.com/) show, in Paris Le Zenith.  
I just looove this band. My favorites artists right now. (And those who know me, know what it means...)  
They have a few albums produced, and are preparing the next one.  
They do great live performances too, 10 or more people on the stage, 2 hours performance, and really interesting mixes of their songs.  
But...  
this last show, I was a little disapointed.  
It was a very dub interpretation of their songs, without the usuals syncop and breaks that make their music so enjoying.  
I guess it's a risk you have to take when you follow really talented artists. They search, research and evolve all the time. Sometimes you might not like it as much as the previous. Painters have their [periods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_piece), why not musicians.  
Anyway, as usual, here is a tatse for you to judge.
