Ironic: we're getting used to being amazed by [Apple](http://www.apple.com) technologies and designs.  


But everybody seems to miss one of the true genius part of their designs:&nbsp;**Evolution**.

Every time they upgrade a product, the previous one seems ugly and old, and the new one sexy.  
They change very little things, but it changes everything.

If&#151;as I am&#151;you're lucky enough to access many different generations of Macs and Apple-branded products, you can't miss it.  
iMacs, iPods, iBooks, PowerBooks... every time. A little bit thiner, a little shinier, a round corner here...

They have _The Thing_
